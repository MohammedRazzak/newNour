ABOUT THE AFRICAN LION
LIONS ARE THE ONLY CATS THAT LIVE IN GROUPS, WHICH ARE CALLED PRIDES. PRIDES ARE FAMILY UNITS THAT MAY INCLUDE UP TO THREE MALES, A DOZEN OR SO FEMALES, AND THEIR YOUNG. ALL OF A PRIDE'S LIONESSES ARE RELATED, AND FEMALE CUBS TYPICALLY STAY WITH THE GROUP AS THEY AGE. YOUNG MALES EVENTUALLY LEAVE AND ESTABLISH THEIR OWN PRIDES BY TAKING OVER A GROUP HEADED BY ANOTHER MALE.
